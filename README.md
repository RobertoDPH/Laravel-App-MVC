# Hi! :smile:

### I've created an app just to practice laravel.
***
It's was a little project for class.

I'm using two diferent databases, one for users data and another one for show data about the world.

If you want to try it, it's important to configure the .env file where all information about the database connection is located and import the file with world data. I use mysql. In the repository there is a .env file example. You need to configure two db connection. Here you have the options you need to change:

- DB_CONNECTION=mysql
- DB_DATABASE= ""
- DB_DATABASE2= ""
- DB_HOST=""
- DB_PORT=""
- DB_USERNAME=""
- DB_PASSWORD=""


It's also important to have php, composer and laravel installed on the device. Here you have a tutorial to install composer and laravel: [Link Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rsx1xPURdc8&ab_channel=Webslesson).
